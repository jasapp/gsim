TODO:
		Working on storing stuff in the machine
		Keep modals in the machine.....
		Keep track of line numbers 
		Parse multiple lines, maybe read from a file
		
		Think about redoing / undoing / stepping through a file...
			  *should the machine store an open gl object, or an image?
			  JOGL, or LWJGL?

		Macro for easy machine code definition.
		Shore up the machine object. (a hash?)
		Scribble all over the machine with OpenGL?
		Tests, duh.
		Some kind of fancy web browser interaction.
